# pendulum-simulator

## running the simulation

Run the script with python3 and images will appear in the render/ directory. I haven't yet implemented a way for the simulation to render itself as a video, just still frames.

```sh
$ python3 pendulum.py
```

## tuning parameters

You have to edit the code directly to change the parameters.
