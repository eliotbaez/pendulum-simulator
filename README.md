# pendulum-simulator

This is a script to module pendular motion, with aspirations of
modeling the motion of a double pendulum.

## Dependencies

You'll have to install the PIL module for the simulation's output to be
meaningful.

```sh
$ pip3 install Pillow
```

## running the simulation

Run the script with python3 and images will appear in the render/
directory. I haven't yet implemented a way for the simulation to render
itself as a video, just still frames.

```sh
$ python3 pendulum.py
```

## tuning parameters

You have to edit the code directly to change the parameters.
